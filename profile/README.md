### open-source fonts by Cyreal

Cyreal is a libre type foundry specializing in Latin and Cyrillic scripts, actively contributing to the open-source movement. We have designed Cyrillic extensions for popular typefaces such as Nunito, Rubik, Mulish, and Raleway. Our original releases — including Lora, Prata, and Alice have become a quiet presence in websites, apps, editorial layouts, and everyday design work.
